# Array-sorting
> The project is about sorting Arrays in according to ascending and descending orders using three different algorithms two simple sorting Techniques and one advanced sorting > technique  The code can operate in 8086 processor which has 16-bit Architecture  and use model small and stack. firstly, the program asks the user to enter the number of elements, > then the program asks him to enter the values of numbers. then the program asks the user to choose the sorting method from three different algorithms (bubble sort , selection sort, quick sort )

# Project Advantages
+ Three types of sorting algorithms.
+ Choosing the method of sorting is based on the user desire.
+ The number of values is variable and determined by the user.
+ Handling for inputs such that the user can only enters Hexa Numbers.
+ The numbers can be sorted ascending or descending.


# Bubble sort 
> it works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
> the algorithm makes about N^(2)⁄2 comparisons.
> If the data is random, a swap is necessary about half the time, so there will be about N^(2)⁄4 swaps.
> Both swaps and comparisons are proportional to N^(2)

# Selection sort
>sorts an array by repeatedly finding the maximum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the ending.
>The selection sort improves on the bubble sort by reducing the number of swaps necessary from O(N^(2)) to O(N).
>the number of comparisons remains O(N^(2)).
>For large values of N, the comparison times will dominate, so we would have to say that the selection sort runs in O(N^(2)) time
